  /* Imperative programming (loops/variables/mutable data) are not recommended:
   * - code becomes hard to read and understand (especially in growing code
   * bases)
   * - vulnerable to concurrency problems (e.g. need for synchronization)
   *
   * Imperative programming can help
   * - for performance-critical applications (0.1% of cases; Akka/ZIO/Cats are
   * already quite fast)
   * - for interactions with Java libraries (usually mutable)
   *
   * Using imperative programming in Scala for no good reason defeats the
   * purpose of Scala. */
